                            Apples and Oranges is a mobile app developed with a team of four students over the course of
                            one
                            semester using Ionic Framework (TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS). It was designed for
                            entertainment
                            purposes, with the goal being to settle disputes or make decisions in a lighthearted way.
                            Enter any two words, and it queries Datamuse API to gather information about the words,
                            select a
                            winner
                            between the two, and present that winner in an apparently-intelligent way.<br><br>

                            In the summer of 2019, I worked in Macalester's AI and robotics lab with two other students
                            and a faculty mentor. Our primary task was to design, train, and integrate a convolutional
                            neural
                            network into an existing robot navigation system using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
                            Over the course of 10 weeks, we achieved our goal of significant
                            improvements in performance and accuracy. The lab's GitHub is linked below.
                            My contributions are primarily in the main codebase catkin_ws, and compass_recorder, an
                            Android
                            app developed to streamline the training data collection process.<br><br>

                            Crossword Solver is my senior capstone project. A collaboration with two other students, it was 
                            developed in Python over the course of a semester. Crossword Solver gathers information from 
                            Google search and Datamuse API (see also: my Apples and Oranges project). It takes this information
                            and makes use of an informed depth-first search as well as other techniques from the field of AI to
                            solve a given crossword puzzle.

                            A side project in the summer 2019 Macalester AI and Robotics lab, we developed a keyboard
                            control scheme for our Parrot Bebop drone using Python. We also experimented with various
                            computer vision object tracking techniques including face tracking, color tracking, and
                            QR code reading to achieve autonomous flying.<br><br>

                            This is a project developed in Java with a team of three students. It is an implementation
                            of two
                            well-known algorithms for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph: Prim's algorithm
                            and Kruskal's Algorithm. We demonstrated applications of these algorithms by applying them
                            to the
                            sidewalks in Macalester College. Knowing the minimum spanning tree of the sidewalks could,

                            allow workers to plow the sidewalks in an efficient way so that all the campus's buildings
                            are

                            MetroTransit.
                            A group of three students used data provided by MetroTransit to explore relationships
                            between
                            demographics and transit ridership. The analysis was conducted in R, using a variety of
                            packages
                            including dplyr, tidyverse, and leaflet, among others.<br><br>

                            gaining familiarity with JavaFX and serialization. It allows you to add and remove items to
                            the list
                            which consist of a title, description, and date. The items on the list persist across
                            sessions.<br><br>
